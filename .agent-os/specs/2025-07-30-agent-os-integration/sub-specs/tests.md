# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Agent OS Integration Components**
- Test Agent OS directory structure creation
- Test configuration file generation
- Test template rendering for engineering applications
- Test documentation generation functions
- Test compatibility with existing YAML configuration system

**Documentation Generation**
- Test automatic documentation generation for individual engineering applications
- Test documentation parsing for Python modules (API579.py, ETL.py, pipe.py, etc.)
- Test YAML configuration documentation extraction
- Test documentation file creation and updates

### Integration Tests

**Engineering Application Compatibility**
- Test Agent OS workflows with existing engineering applications
- Test spec creation process for engineering-specific features
- Test task execution with existing pytest framework
- Test git workflow integration with existing repository structure
- Test conda environment compatibility during Agent OS operations

**Workflow Integration**
- Test complete spec-to-implementation workflow using existing engineering application
- Test task management for multi-application engineering projects
- Test documentation generation during development workflow
- Test Agent OS commands with existing Windows batch scripts

### System Tests

**End-to-End Engineering Workflow**
- Test creating spec for new engineering application enhancement
- Test implementing changes using Agent OS task management
- Test running existing pytest suite after Agent OS integration
- Test documentation generation for newly implemented features
- Test git workflow from spec creation through pull request

**Compatibility Verification**
- Test all 20+ existing engineering applications continue to function
- Test YAML configuration loading and processing
- Test database connections (PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle) remain functional
- Test scientific computing stack (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) operations
- Test Windows batch script execution

### Performance Tests

**Documentation Generation Performance**
- Test documentation generation time for large engineering applications
- Test memory usage during bulk documentation generation
- Test Agent OS startup time with large engineering codebase

### Mocking Requirements

- **Git Operations:** Mock git commands during testing to avoid repository changes
- **File System Operations:** Mock file creation/modification for testing documentation generation
- **Database Connections:** Mock database connections during integration testing
- **External Process Calls:** Mock Windows batch script execution during testing
- **Conda Environment:** Mock conda environment operations to avoid environment changes

## Test Data Requirements

- **Sample Engineering Applications:** Create test versions of key applications (API579.py, ETL.py, pipe.py)
- **Sample YAML Configurations:** Test configuration files representing existing system patterns
- **Sample Documentation:** Expected documentation output for validation
- **Test Repository Structure:** Mirror existing repository structure for integration testing

## Testing Strategy

1. **Isolation:** All tests must run without affecting existing engineering applications
2. **Compatibility:** Tests must verify existing functionality remains unchanged
3. **Documentation:** Tests must validate generated documentation accuracy
4. **Performance:** Tests must ensure Agent OS integration doesn't slow down existing workflows
5. **Rollback:** Tests must verify complete rollback capability if needed
