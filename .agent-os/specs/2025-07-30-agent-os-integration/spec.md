## Overview

Integrate Agent OS development framework into this Python-based engineering computation library repository to enable multi-system team collaboration with trunk-based development, automated git bash workflows, and synchronized sub-agents. This integration will provide structured spec creation, task management, and standardized documentation processes optimized for distributed scientific computing teams working on mathematical analysis, engineering calculations, and computational modeling applications.

## User Stories

### Multi-System Engineering Computation Team Collaboration

As an engineering developer working on this scientific computation library across multiple systems, I want to use Agent OS with trunk-based development and automated git bash scripts, so that I can collaborate seamlessly with team members while maintaining consistent workflows and synchronized states for both mathematical analysis development and engineering calculation validation tasks.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer creates new engineering computation spec using `/create-spec` command
2. The system automatically creates trunk-based git branch for this scientific computing spec
3. Sub-agents are configured in .agent-os folder for engineering computation team synchronization
4. Git bash scripts automate Python scientific computing tasks, mathematical analysis validation, and library testing
5. All team members work on main branch with feature flags and continuous integration for engineering features
