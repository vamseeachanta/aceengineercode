## 2025-07-31: Agent OS Integration and Documentation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Technical Lead

### Decision

Complete Agent OS integration for AceEngineerCode platform by creating comprehensive product documentation that reflects the existing mature engineering analysis capabilities, modular architecture, and industry-specific focus.

### Context

Analysis of the existing codebase revealed a sophisticated marine offshore structural engineering analysis platform with 25+ analysis modules, comprehensive YAML configuration system, OrcaFlex integration, and extensive engineering calculation capabilities. The platform was missing Agent OS product documentation despite having advanced Agent OS spec integration.

### Rationale

The platform represents significant development investment and proven engineering capabilities that need proper documentation for:
- Team collaboration and knowledge management
- Future development planning and prioritization
- Standardized development workflows using Agent OS framework
- Clear product positioning and roadmap definition

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Structured development workflows using Agent OS framework
- Clear product mission and roadmap for future development
- Standardized documentation for team collaboration
- Foundation for systematic feature planning and implementation

**Negative:**
- Additional documentation maintenance overhead
- Need for periodic review and updates of product documentation
- Potential resistance to new documentation processes

## 2025-07-31: Modular Architecture Validation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, Engineering Team

### Decision

Maintain and enhance the existing modular architecture with Application Manager pattern, recognizing it as the optimal approach for the complex engineering analysis domain.

### Context

The current codebase implements a sophisticated modular architecture with:
- Application Manager for centralized control
- 25+ specialized analysis modules
- Common utilities library with 30+ components
- YAML-based configuration system
- Integrated database and reporting systems

### Rationale

The modular architecture provides:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each analysis type is isolated and maintainable
- **Scalability:** New analysis modules can be added without affecting existing functionality
- **Flexibility:** Engineers can use only required analysis components
- **Maintainability:** Isolated modules reduce complexity and testing overhead

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Continued architectural consistency and maintainability
- Easy integration of new analysis capabilities
- Clear separation between different engineering analysis domains
- Simplified testing and validation of individual analysis components

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in inter-module communication
- Need for careful interface design between modules
- Potential for module dependency conflicts

## 2025-07-31: Industry Standards Focus

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Engineering Experts

### Decision

Maintain focus on marine offshore structural engineering industry standards (API 579, DNVGL, ASME) while positioning for future expansion to additional industry sectors.

### Context

The platform currently implements comprehensive support for:
- API 579 fitness-for-service assessments
- OrcaFlex dynamic analysis integration
- Marine riser and pipeline analysis
- Offshore structural engineering calculations
- Industry-specific reporting and compliance requirements

### Rationale

Deep industry focus provides:
- **Competitive Advantage:** Specialized expertise in marine offshore engineering
- **Market Position:** Clear differentiation from generic engineering software
- **User Value:** Purpose-built solutions for specific industry challenges
- **Compliance:** Built-in support for industry standards and regulations

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Strong market position in marine offshore engineering sector
- Deep domain expertise and specialized functionality
- Clear value proposition for target customers
- Foundation for industry-specific certifications and validations

**Negative:**
- Limited market size compared to generic engineering tools
- Need for continuous updates as industry standards evolve
- Potential difficulty in expanding to other industry sectors
- Dependence on marine offshore engineering market health

## 2025-07-31: YAML Configuration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Users

### Decision

Continue using YAML-based configuration system for analysis parameters, project settings, and module configuration, while enhancing with validation and templating capabilities.

### Context

The current system uses extensive YAML configuration files for:
- Analysis module parameters
- Project-specific settings
- Database configuration
- Report templates and formatting
- User preferences and workflow customization

### Rationale

YAML configuration provides:
- **Human Readability:** Engineers can easily understand and modify configurations
- **Version Control:** Configuration changes can be tracked and managed
- **Flexibility:** Complex nested configurations for sophisticated analysis scenarios
- **Portability:** Configurations can be shared and reused across projects

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Maintainable and traceable configuration management
- Easy customization for different project requirements
- Version-controlled configuration history
- Simplified deployment and environment management

**Negative:**
- Potential for configuration syntax errors by users
- Need for validation and error checking systems
- Limited GUI configuration capabilities
- Dependency on YAML parsing libraries and standards
