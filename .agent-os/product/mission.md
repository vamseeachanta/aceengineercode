## Pitch

AceEngineerCode is a comprehensive marine offshore structural engineering analysis platform that helps structural engineers and offshore consultants automate complex calculations and assessments by providing a unified suite of specialized analysis tools for API 579, OrcaFlex, VIV analysis, and fatigue assessments.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Structural Engineers**: Professional engineers working on offshore platforms, pipelines, and marine structures
- **Offshore Engineering Consultants**: Consultants providing specialized analysis services to oil & gas companies
- **Oil & Gas Companies**: Companies requiring fitness-for-service assessments and structural integrity evaluations

### User Personas

**Senior Offshore Structural Engineer** (30-55 years old)
- **Role:** Lead Structural Engineer / Technical Specialist
- **Context:** Designing and analyzing offshore platforms, risers, and subsea structures
- **Pain Points:** Manual calculations are time-intensive, complex standards compliance, repetitive analysis workflows
- **Goals:** Automated analysis workflows, standardized reporting, compliance with industry standards

**Engineering Consultant** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Principal Engineer / Project Manager
- **Context:** Providing specialized engineering services to multiple clients
- **Pain Points:** Inconsistent analysis approaches, manual report generation, difficulty scaling analysis capacity
- **Goals:** Standardized methodologies, efficient project delivery, professional reporting capabilities

## The Problem

### Manual Engineering Calculations

Offshore structural engineering requires complex calculations following multiple industry standards (API 579, DNVGL, ASME). Manual calculations are time-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to verify. This leads to project delays and increased risk of errors.

**Our Solution:** Provide automated calculation engines that implement industry standards with built-in verification and standardized reporting.

### Fragmented Analysis Tools

Engineers use multiple software packages for different types of analysis (OrcaFlex for dynamics, custom spreadsheets for API 579, separate tools for fatigue). This fragmentation leads to data transfer errors and workflow inefficiencies.

**Our Solution:** Integrate multiple analysis capabilities into a unified platform with consistent data models and seamless workflow integration.

### Inconsistent Reporting

Engineering analysis results are often presented in inconsistent formats across different projects and analysis types. This makes review and validation difficult for clients and regulatory bodies.

**Our Solution:** Standardized reporting templates with automated generation capabilities that ensure consistency and compliance with industry requirements.

## Differentiators

### Industry Standards Integration

Unlike generic engineering software, we provide purpose-built implementations of offshore industry standards (API 579, DNVGL-OS-F101, ASME B31). This results in faster project delivery and guaranteed compliance with industry requirements.

### OrcaFlex Integration

Unlike standalone analysis tools, we provide seamless integration with OrcaFlex for dynamic analysis workflows. This enables comprehensive riser analysis from conceptual design through detailed assessment without data conversion steps.

### Modular Architecture

Unlike monolithic engineering software, our modular system allows engineers to use only needed analysis components while maintaining data consistency. This results in faster execution and easier maintenance for specialized workflows.
